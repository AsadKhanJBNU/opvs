# Large-Scale Hybrid Residual Graph Neural Networks with Transfer Learning for Multi-Property Prediction in Organic Photovoltaics and Organic Materials
The rational design of high‐performance organic photovoltaics (OPVs) hinges on decoding the structure–property relationships that govern open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and bandgap, with power conversion efficiency ultimately determining device viability. Here, we present an experimentally validated Hybrid Residual Graph Neural Network (RGNN) that accurately predicts key OPV properties from molecular representations. Using over 2.3 million compounds from the Harvard Clean Energy Project (HCEP), we curated a high-quality dataset through rigorous preprocessing and optimized model performance via automated hyperparameter tuning. The resulting framework delivers consistently low prediction errors across training, validation, and test sets for all target properties. We further integrate molecular similarity analysis using the Tanimoto index and demonstrate transferability by fine-tuning the RGNN on the organic material database (OMDB) dataset of 12,500 organic molecules, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches in bandgap prediction. Independent experimental validation confirms strong agreement between predictions and measured outcomes. To accelerate community adoption, we release an open-access web platform that unifies large-scale dataset analysis, property prediction, and molecular similarity search in a single interface. This work establishes a robust, transferable, and experimentally grounded AI framework to guide molecular discovery in next-generation OPVs.
